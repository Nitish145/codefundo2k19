## Our Solution

We aim at identifying the best suited probable points for setting up a secure electronic voting system. Our model would be secure enough so that no one would be able to know whom the voter voted for. Also, Smart contracts can be deployed for keeping voting data confidential.

The following would be the integral parts of our e-voting system:

   A. Watchdog organization

   - Holds voter information and should determine voter validity.
   - Should not expose voter information to any other party.


   B. Smart Contracts

   - Validate voters at the time of voting.
   - Acts as an agent between the watchdog organization and the voters.
   - The anonymity of voter information to prevent potential manipulation of votes.
   - Distributed and immutable.


   C. Azure Blockchain

   - Each vote is conceptually equivalent to the asset in blockchain and transaction happens between voter and candidate.
   - Restrict asset to a process maximum of one transaction to potentially prevent multiple votes to the same candidate or voting for multiple contenders.


### Tasks
 
   A. Before Voting  
 
   - The registration of the voters and contestants is done with the watchdog organization.
   - The voters will be identified with the unique identification number (UIN) assigned by the watchdog organization after registration.
   - UIN would be used throughout the process to potentially prevent multiple voting. 
   - The contestants would file their nomination with their voter id.
   -  A public address would be generated and stored against each of the candidates.

   B. During Voting 

   - Verification of the UIN by Smart Contracts with the watchdog organization.
   - With the UIN, an internally hashed reference number will be generated by the Smart Contracts and stored with the vote/asset.
   - A public key generated using the blockchain network will be stored against the reference number of the voter.
   - Restricting the no. of transactions/votes to one between registered voters and the candidates.

   C. After Voting 

   - The vote/asset pertaining to a reference number could be changed before the deadline.
   - After the deadline, Microsoft power BI could be used to prepare the detailed results be it party-wise or constituency-wise.
